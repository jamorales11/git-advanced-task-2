Tracking Branches
Checking out a local branch from a remote-tracking branch automatically creates what is 
called a “tracking branch” (and the branch it tracks is called an “upstream branch”). 
Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch.
What is Git Upstream Branch?
When you want to checkout a branch in git from a remote repository such as GitHub or Bit
bucket, the “Upstream Branch” is the remote branch hosted on Github or Bitbucket. 
It’s the branch you fetch/pull from whenever you issue a plain git fetch/git pull 
basically without arguments.
